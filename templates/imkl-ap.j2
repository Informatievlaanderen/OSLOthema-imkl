{% block summary %}
<p>
The OSLO-IMKL application profile shows how terms from the corresponding <a href="https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/mobiliteit/imkl">vocabulary</a> should be used to represent cable and pipeline information, both above-ground and underground.
</p>

<p>
With this data, the aim is to reduce excavation damage underground by mapping key elements. 
</p>

<p>
The model consists of five parts. The first part is the upper part of the model. This describes the components of a network, as defined in INSPIRE's European standard - Utility Services. 
</p>

<p>
The second part is on the left side of the model, under the Utility Link Set. Below this, it distinguishes between cables, pipes and ducts. In turn, ducts are also further subdivided into the different types of pipes.
</p>

<p>
The third section describes the subdivision of Utility Node and Utility Node Container. The Utility Node represents how a node is represented in the network. The Utility Node Container represents which elements comprise the node. 
</p>

<p>
The fourth part is the code lists at the bottom. These non-terminal lists represent the completion of specific attributes. 
</p>

<p>
The last part are the data types on the right-hand side. This section describes all the different data types.
